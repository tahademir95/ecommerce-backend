# E-Commerce Web App

This is the web application for e-commerce that will have a super user side, product seller side and a user side. The super user will be able to confirm the product seller when they registered in the system and also be able to design the user and product seller sides' pages in terms of carousel image or so on . Furthermore, the super user will decide the category and subcategories that product seller side will sell their products in that categories. That's to say, product seller will not be able to create a new category or subcategory. They just can choose the categories that their products are related with. So, product seller can add their products to system with some information such as products’ name, brand, cost and features of products. As you can guess, the user side will be able to choose product, add it to cart, list the products that are in the same subcategory in terms of the feature etc.

Now, the capability of the application is the CRUD operation of product, product category, product subcategory, subcategory feature and product feature detail that are explained in detail below.

Swagger is also connected. When project is started, go to this ``` http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ ``` url to see E-Commerce Application API. Swagger UI page is authenticated with JDBC authentication. At first to access swagger ui, the admin should insert a user with username and password -which must be saved as hashed one of the original password for the security- to users table, also insert authority with authority name "auth" and the username that is authenticated to authorities table. Then, any user having auth role in db can access Swagger UI page with his/her username and password.

HATEOAS is implemented. Thanks to the HATEOAS, some extra informations are provided and it says what we can do next. The idea is to embed links within the JSON documents. 

## Technologies that I have been using;
-	Spring Boot
-   Spring Security
-	Hibernate
-	PostgreSQL
-	Restful API
-   Swagger OpenAPI
-   HATEOAS

## 2. How to save data into the database from the beginning?

### A. **POST** ``` /product-category/category ```

Firstly, you have to add a category into the database.

```JS
{
   "categoryName": "Cell Phones & Accessories"
}
```

### B. **GET** ``` /product-category/categories ```

To see the list of the categories that you have added and learn their {id}s. When added subcategories to related category, the subcategories that you saw above will enlarge.

```JS
[
   {
      "pc_id": 42,
      "categoryName": "Cell Phones & Accessories",
      "subCategories": []
   }
]
```

### C. **POST** ``` /product-subcategory/subcategory ```

Then, you should specify which category that we will add the sub-category under of.

```JS
{
   "subCategoryName": "Cell Phones",
   "productCategory": {
      "pc_id": 42
   }
}
```

### D. **GET** ``` /product-subcategory/subcategories ```

To see the subcategory list and learn the ids of them. Also when added subcategory feature that should be related to subcategory, you will be able to see the subcategory features of any subcategory.

      "psc_id": 43,
      "subCategoryName": "Cell Phones",
      "subCategoryFeatures": []
   }
]
```

 * When you get request to ``` /product-category/categories ``` again, you will get;
 
    ```JS
    {
       "pc_id": 42,
       "categoryName": "Cell Phones & Accessories",
       "subCategories": [
          {
             "psc_id": 43,
             "subCategoryName": "Cell Phones",

    ```
    
    You should realize that **subcategories** field enlarge after adding information to product subcategory.

### E. **POST** ``` /subcategory-feature/feature ```

The general features of the added subcategory are added. For instance, if the added subcategory is telephone, then the features of the subcategory that will be added can be the phone's front camera, phone size, etc. In order to add a new feature for a subcategory, you must give the id of that subcategory to indicate which subcategory it belongs to.  

```JS
{
   "subCategoryFeatureName": "Front Camera",
   "subCategory": {
      "psc_id": 43
   }
}
```

### F. **GET** ``` /subcategory-feature/features ```

      "subCategoryFeatureName": "Front Camera",
      "productFeatureDetails": []
   }
]
```

              "productFeatureDetails":[]

   ```
   
   You should realize that **subCategoryFeatures** field enlarge after adding information to subcategory feature.

### G. **POST** ``` /product-feature-detail/detail ```

The features of the products are added under the features of the subcategory. That’s to say, if we follow our case, we have added phone’s front camera to subcategory. Now, specify the feature of front cameras such as 8MP or 12MP… To do this, we must specify the subcategory feature id.

```JS
{
   "productFeatureDetail": "8 MP",
   "subCategoryFeature": {
      "scf_id": 44
   }
}
```

      }
   ]
   ```

### I. **POST** ``` /product/product ```

Finally, we can add a product by specifying it’s name, brand, cost, under which category it will, under which subcategory it will and which feature detail it has.

   "productCategory": {
      "pc_id": 42
   },
   "subCategory": {

                     "subCategoryName": "Cell Phones"
                  },
                  "featureDetails": [
